            /*
            Factors to consider:
                - Whenever the intervals array is empty, the snake by then has straighten
                  out into a single direction, and the number of cubes for a translation
                  for the next upcoming interval would then be
                  cubesinInterval = snake.length -2;
                - When just starting, set the cubesinInterval to snake.length - 2
                - When the intervals array is empty, hence there are no intervals queued
                  for the camera to rotate to a new position, just create a IntervalPosition
                  object with the instance fields of remainingCubes as 1 and generic offset
                  with the latest direction. Soon after call the method
                  calculateNewPosition to get the next position for the camera to translate to,
                  rather than translating to the cube preceding where the head is currently now,
                  just proceded to the cube position after the tail, so:

                  intersection is a cube object
                  var intersection = snake[snake.length - 2]
                  calculateNewPosition(intersection)

                - Push this IntervalPosition interval object onto the intervals array and call
                  thirdPersonCamera.update(intervals, snake[0], direction), the head  here must
                  already be updated!

                - The camera is set to a position of (50, 50, 50) initially
                - the camera is not associated with any cube
                - the instance variable cubesinInterval is set to 0 and increments
                  whenever animate occurs.  
                - a direction is detected 
                
                The snake may not change direction, so every interval would be the
                  length of the snake and that repeats itself.
                - At the start of the game, the direction and number of cubes is
                  already initialized, therefore, a intervalPosition object can be
                  constructed with the direction and snake.length values as the
                  values for instance fields genericOffset and remainingCubes,
                  respectively.
                - Additionally, newPosition can be calculated for the interval, as
                  the position where the camera will have to shift is direction is
                  already one cube behind the head of the snake.

            // keys.length is greater than 0, then the instance variable interval
